Apple App Store Approval Checklist
===================================

General Requirements:
----------------------
1. Fully functional app with no crashes or incomplete features.
2. Compliance with Apple’s App Store Guidelines:
   - Functionality
   - Performance
   - Privacy
   - Security
3. A signed privacy policy detailing how user data is collected, used, and stored.
4. Code signing with a valid certificate via Xcode.

Architectural Considerations:
-----------------------------
1. JSON Structure:
   - Must handle missing fields gracefully (e.g., fallback defaults for missing captions or images).
   - Ensure category-restaurant relationships are intact (`category_id` must match a valid category key).
   - Test with large datasets to ensure scalability and performance (e.g., hundreds of categories or restaurants).
   - Validate all JSON data input (e.g., no malformed data).
2. Firebase Integration:
   - Efficient data fetching: Query only necessary data for UI components.
   - Handle network errors and offline mode:
     - Cache data locally and sync updates when back online.
   - Test real-time updates:
     - Ensure changes in Firebase reflect properly in the app.
3. Image Handling:
   - Validate all `photo` URLs to ensure they load successfully.
   - Provide fallback placeholders for missing or invalid images.

Performance:
------------
1. Optimize loading for large datasets (e.g., use lazy loading or pagination for long lists of restaurants).
2. Minimize app resource usage to avoid slowdowns or crashes.
3. Test app responsiveness in various scenarios:
   - Slow network connections
   - Offline mode
   - High user interaction load

UI/UX Requirements:
--------------------
1. Provide clear feedback to users:
   - Error messages for missing data or connectivity issues.
   - Loading indicators for data fetch operations.
2. Ensure consistent and intuitive navigation:
   - Seamless transition between categories and restaurants.
3. Test layouts on multiple devices and orientations (e.g., iPhone, iPad, landscape, portrait).

Testing:
--------
1. Thorough testing on real devices using Xcode to ensure:
   - Compatibility with various screen sizes and iOS versions.
   - No crashes or performance lags.
2. Beta testing with TestFlight:
   - Invite external testers to catch bugs or improve UX.
3. Handle edge cases:
   - Missing data
   - Large datasets
   - User input errors

Privacy and Security:
---------------------
1. Comply with Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework if collecting user data.
2. Store sensitive data securely and avoid unnecessary data collection.
3. Provide clear explanations of any permissions requested (e.g., location services).

Deployment:
-----------
1. Include all necessary metadata in App Store Connect:
   - App name
   - Description
   - Keywords
   - Screenshots for various devices
   - App icon (1024x1024px)
2. Submit the app via Xcode and ensure the build passes validation.
3. Address any feedback or rejection reasons promptly during Apple’s review process.
4. Test app readiness by simulating App Store reviewers’ typical usage.
